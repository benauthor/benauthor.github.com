<p>
The Buddhist scriptures tell us there are eight objections to living in a house:<br>
it is a lot of trouble to build;<br>
it must be kept in repair;<br>
some nobleman might seize it;<br>
too many people may want to live in or visit it;<br>
it makes the body tender;<br>
it provides concealment for committing evil deeds;<br>
it causes pride of ownership,<br>
and it harbors lice and bugs.
</p>

<p>
There are ten advantages, on the other hand, in residing under a tree:<br>
it can be found with ease;<br>
it can be found in any locality;<br>
the sight of falling leaves is a reminder of the impermanence of life;<br>
a tree arouses no covetous thoughts;<br>
it affords no opportunity for evil deeds;<br>
it is not received from any person;<br>
it is inhabited by good spirits;<br>
it needs no fence;<br>
it promotes health;<br>
it does not involve worldly attachments.
