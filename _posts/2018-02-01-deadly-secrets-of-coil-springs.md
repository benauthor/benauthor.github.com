## Deadly Secrets of the Amazon Coil Spring

"Whoa, what are you doing, you need a spring compressor," said my
neighbor Nick as he walked by. I was hacking on my 1968 Volvo Amazon,
outdoors in January in New York City. He kindly neglected to point out
that the whole context was idiotic. "Wait until April" would have been
justifiable, but he politely focused on proximate danger. "My buddy
broke his jaw when a spring popped out and hit him in the face," he
continued.

"I'm just following the book," I said defensively. In fact, I have
three shop manuals that cover this car: the Haynes, the Autopress, and
the Clymer, and all three claim you can replace front coil springs
with nothing more than a floor jack, jack stands, grit, and
determination.  However, they differ on tactical details.

After convincing Nick I was not under immediate threat of grave bodily
harm, I went back to my predicament. Have a look at the front suspension:

All blown apart like this, looks simple, right? Pull out the shock and
the spring is free. However, in practice you'll discover that the
upper and lower wishbones tend in fact not to be floating in space as
shown, but connected by the steering knuckle. The question becomes:
how to free the wishbones from each other so that you can open up the
space between (slowly, using the jack, so as not to break your face) and
remove the spring.

Haynes suggested, in a fit of wishful thinking, that one might just
remove the castellated nut on the lower ball joint and take it apart.
Anyone who's ever met a ball joint, however, knows they don't come
apart without significant convincing with a pickle fork, typically
destroying the boot, or a more civilized ball-joint press. I didn't
have a pickle fork, nor a new boot, nor a press.

To save on suspense, let me come out and say it: the easiest way to
free the lower wishbone is to remove the four bolts holding the lower
portion of the ball joint to the wishbone (and incidentally the bump
stop as well). You could probably disconnect at the top instead, but
that's going to yank on your brake line in a way you're not going to
like.

So here's the whole procedure that worked for me:

1. Jack up car, support on jack stands.

2. Remove wheel.

3. Free shock on top and bottom. This was a whole deal. My Bilsteins
have a 5mm hex socket in the top that wasn't immediately obvious, but
which let me remove the nut without spinning the shock. Brilliant
engineering, Bilstein!  Unfortunately the lower nut and threads were
extraordinarily rusty (salty winters!), and have only small wrench
flats to turn against, which are no match for the rust. A strap wrench
might be the answer (if it's not too bad -- a nut splitter and new nut
if worse comes to worse) but I didn't think ahead. Instead, I just
removed the bolt holding the small lower shock retaining plate. Maybe
this is obvious, I don't know, but the books offered no detail here.

4. Disconnect the sway bar.

5. Support the lower wishbone with the jack and remove the four aforementioned
bolts connecting ball joint to lower wishbone.

6. Release jack slowly and let spring decompress.

7. The spring doesn't just fall out. Yank on it like a fool until it
comes out.

8. Now reverse it all...

9. New spring in -- this is where the spring compressor would make
things less awkward, without it you might need to lever the bottom in
with that pickle fork you didn't use or whatever you've got on hand.

10. Put jack under the wishbone and carefully raise until you're aligned
well enough to reconnect the ball joint. Don't forget to put the bump
stock on ($%!@#).

11. Reconnect sway bar.

12. Reinstall shock.

13. Wheel.

14. Lower. Tighten those lug nuts.

15. Drive gingerly, listening to interesting new pings as the springs
settle in and exercise your shot bushings in a whole new way.

For the record, the rear coil springs are replaceable in a similar
manner, but it's all much more obvious. If you're like me, you'll do
these outdoors in the winter as well, with the benefit of an
unexpected cold rain!  As with the fronts, the bottom shock nut is
probably going to be horribly rusted, and a spring compressor will
make reassembly possible with fewer curse words.
